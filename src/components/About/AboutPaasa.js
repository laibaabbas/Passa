                Pakistan Australian Association of South Australia (PAASA) was
                formed in 1984 by a small group of people from Pakistani origin

                Farooqi and Rukhsana Farooqi, Mr Ashraf Choudhry and his family,
                Dr A. Farooque and Roshan Farooque . Mr Shamim Noori was elected
                as the first President of PAASA, Masood Chaudhry (Vice
                President), Dr. Farooque (Treasurer) and Khalid Farooqui
                (Secretary). In 1986 the second President of PAASA's was
                elected, Dr Farooque. Due to the contribution of our founder
                members the Pakistani Australian Association of SA has greatly
                flourished and provided the community a platform where Pakistani
                families can get to gather and celebrate special occasions.

                Association's main charter and evolving it to provide better
